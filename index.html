    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      Decision Making (if-else and switch): ( choose at least 2 tasks from
      below)
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Leap Year Checker: Create a function that takes a year as input and
        determines whether it is a leap year or not. Leap years are divisible by
        4, but not by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.
      </li>

      <li>
        Palindrome Checker: Create a recursive function to check if a given
        string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), ignoring
        spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
      </li>
